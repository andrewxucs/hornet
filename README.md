## Introduction
The idea of this project is to test the strength of a password by attempting to crack it, hence why the name of this project is inspired by the animals that attack beehives.
The password cracker combines the efficient dictionary attack with the brute force attack by testing different variations on every entry of dictionary.txt

## Credits
The entries in the dictionary were compiled by LethargicLeprechaun. However, practically any dictionary works with hornet.
